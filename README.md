This game was made for week 14 of Siege Hackclub THE LAST WEEK, I enjoyedm making this one with the impelementation mind-bending logic and cool features, for the reviewers play on cheat mode (aka for noobs mode) :).

P.S. The Superliminal mechanic was too hard to make it work with movement so only wherever you look.
